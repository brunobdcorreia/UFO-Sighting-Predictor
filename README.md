# UFO Sighting Predictor
## A small Python and Flask web app to predict UFO Sightings
> Made as practice for Microsoft's 'Learn ML' curriculum, it utilizes [NUFORC](https://nuforc.org)'s UFO sightings dataset to train a Logistic Regression model (currently with 95% accuracy) to predict in which country a UFO might be sighted, given the amount of time it'd be seen for, latitude, and longitude.
